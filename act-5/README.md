# E-Commerce Product Card 5️⃣

In this activity, you are stepping into the shoes of a web developer tasked with enhancing an e-commerce website's product item cards. The challenge is presented in a real-world context where you'll need to address and fulfill the requirements of a client. As you work through this scenario, image you are in direct communication with the client, understanding their needs, and applying your CSS skills to deliver the desired outcom

## Scenario

Imaging your client runs a popular online store selling a wide range of products. They're looking to refresh the look of their product pages to boost sales and improve the shopping experience for their customers. During a meeting, your client explains their visions and provides specific requirements they want to be implemented.

## The Client's Request

- **Sale Indicator:** The client is planning a sales event and wants each product on sale to be clearly marked. They've asked for a noticeable "Sale" label to be added to the top of the product item cards, making it easy for customers to spot great deals.
- **Prominent Pricing:** Feedback has indicated that the pricing on product cards should stand out more. The client wants the font size of the price to be increased to catch the shopper's eye better.
- **Button Enhancement:** To make the product cards more interactive and user-friendly, the client desires two changes to the button on each card:
  - Change the text from "Buy" to "Add to Cart" to be more descriptive.
  - Implement a color change on hover to improve visual feedback and interactivity.

Your task is to use your CSS skills to implement these changes, ensuring the product cards are both functional and appealing. This scenario-based activity will test your ability to apply CSS properties related to positioning, typography, the box model, color changes, and user interaction cues.

## Your Role

As the developer, it's your job to translate the client's needs into a tangible design enhancement. This activity will require you to think critically about how to use CSS to achieve the desired effects without overhauling the existing layout. Your work will directly impact the user experience and potentially drive higher engagement and sales on the client's e-commerce platform.

By the end of this activity, you'll have practiced scenario-based web development, addressing specific client requests to improve a website's design and functionality. This exercise will not only enhance your CSS skills but also prepare you for real-world projects where understanding and fulfilling client requirements are key to success.
