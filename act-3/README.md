# Sticky Header with a Dropdown Menu

In modern web design, sticky headers with dropdown menus are a staple for enhancing navigation usability. This complex activity involves using CSS to create a sticky header that remains at the top of the viewport as you scroll, along with a dropdown menu that appears when hovering over a menu item.

## Objective

To create a sticky header with a CSS-only dropdown menu, applying advanced CSS positioning and display properties.

## Expected Output

#### Sticky Header

- The header should remains fixed at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls through the page, ensuring constant access to the navigation menu. The header contains the links to various sections of the website, with a dropdown menu under "Services" for additional options.

#### Navigation Menu and Dropdown

- The navigation menu is centered and each item is displayed inline with a right margin for spacing. The dropdown menu under "Services" becomes visible upon hovering, revealing additional service options.

#### Content and Section Headings

- The content starts below the sticky header, ensuring it's not overlapped or hidden.
- Each section is designed to take up significant vertical space, with the home section being particularly tall (`100vh`), showcasing a large heading (`h1`) styled prominently.
- The headings for each sections also, you can use `position: sticky` with a top value set to the height navigation, just below the sticky header. This ensures that as you scroll through each section, its heading sticks to just below the header, maintaining context before moving on to the next content block.

#### Contact Section List Syling

- The contact section features a list with no default bullet points, custom padding, background color, and rounded borders for each item, creating a distinct, modern look for contact information or options.

## Extra Challenge

- **Smooth Scrolling:** Implement smooth scrolling via CSS with `scroll-behavior: smooth` on the `html` element to enhance the navigation experience when clicking on anchor links.

## Things to Remember

- Using `position: sticky` is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. An element is treated as relatively positioned until it crosses a specified point, then it acts as fixed positioned. The `top` value is crucial for defining when the stickiness activates.
- When working with multiple sticky elements or a sticky header, managing `z-index` values is key to ensuring elements layer correctly without unintended overlap.
- Check browser compatibility for CSS properties like `position: sticky;` and the transition effects to ensure a consistent experience across different browsers and devices.

This activity offers a practical application of CSS positioning to create a dynamic and user-friendly webpage layout, reflecting common patterns seen in modern web design.
